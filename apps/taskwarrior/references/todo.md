### To Do's

* Create a method to clean up the package directory between builds
** Empty source and pkg-root directories should do it
* Set the docker image to cd into the apps directory in app when it starts
* Add a prompt to build the test in ./build-[app name] script
* Consider writing a log file of the build to track progress and make breakages easier to spot
* extra super bonus points if you can restart the script at the part that breaks
